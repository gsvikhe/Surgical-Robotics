This MATLAB code has the basic kinematics and statics for a notched endoscope. 
Further Improvements in the form of better looking plots, a more generalized Wrist class need to be made. 

The code is based on the following paper:
York PA, Swaney PJ, Gilbert HB, Webster RJ. A Wrist for Needle-Sized Surgical Robots. IEEE Int Conf Robot Autom. 2015;2015:1776-1781.
